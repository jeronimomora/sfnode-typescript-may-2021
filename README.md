## TypeScript: JavaScript... with types? - Jeronimo Mora

Aimed at those with a beginner to intermediate understanding of JavaScript, such as those who may have recently finished a coding bootcamp, this talk should serve as an intro the (semi) statically typed TypeScript language. It will go through basic/intermediate typing, class types, error checking, compilation, and motivations (why bother?). We will build a small node application using TypeScript from scratch that will demonstrate its use.

## Repository description

Included in this repository is all the code used to give a tech talk at SF Node in May 2021.
